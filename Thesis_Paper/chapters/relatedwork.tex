In this chapter, general definition of data privacy and the necessity to maintain data privacy are described. Furthermore, in order to keep data privacy, this chapter also presents an overview of methods to achieve the goal of privacy preserving data analysis and publication, which have been adopted in several domains. Here, we want to emphasize the use of synthetic data and one of its most popular applications, i.g., differentially private synthetic data, that are able to prevent disclosure in the process of synthetic data generation.
